            </header>

                <p>
                    A <strong>Web Framework</strong> is a software tool that provides a standardized way to build and deploy web applications. It abstracts and automates many of the low-level details involved in web development, allowing developers to focus on higher-level aspects like business logic, user interface, and overall application structure. By offering a collection of libraries, tools, and best practices, web frameworks simplify and speed up the development process.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Use a Web Framework?</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Web frameworks</strong> help developers by handling routine tasks such as URL routing, database interaction, session management, and security features. This leads to more maintainable and scalable code. Additionally, frameworks encourage best practices and design patterns, making the codebase easier to understand and collaborate on.
                </p>

                <h2>Types of Web Frameworks</h2>

                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Front-End Frameworks:</strong> These focus on the client-side of web applications, managing how content is displayed and interacted with by the user. Examples include React, Angular, and Vue.js.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Back-End Frameworks:</strong> These handle the server-side logic, including database operations, authentication, and data processing. Examples include Django, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Full-Stack Frameworks:</strong> These provide tools and libraries for both the front-end and back-end development, offering an all-in-one solution. Examples include Laravel and ASP.NET.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
