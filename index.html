                    What is HTML?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</strong>It is a markup languaage that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The <em>enclosing</em>tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML codes as websites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Main Parts of Elements are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Opening Tag</li>
                        <li>The Closing Tag</li>
                        <li>The Content</li>
                        <li>The Element</li>
                    </ol>
